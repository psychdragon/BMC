# Product Requirements Document: Business Model Canvas Generator

## 1. Introduction

This document outlines the product requirements for the Business Model Canvas (BMC) Generator. The goal of this project is to create a simple, web-based tool that allows users to generate and edit a Business Model Canvas, with the content powered by a Large Language Model (LLM).

## 2. Vision

To provide a user-friendly and accessible tool for entrepreneurs, business students, and professionals to quickly create and iterate on their business models. By leveraging the power of LLMs, the tool will simplify the process of brainstorming and refining business ideas.

## 3. Target Audience

- Entrepreneurs and startup founders
- Business students and educators
- Business consultants and analysts
- Product managers and innovators

## 4. Features

### 4.1. Core Functionality

- **Generate Business Model Canvas:** Users can input a business idea or concept, and the tool will generate a complete Business Model Canvas using an LLM.
- **Edit Canvas Content:** Users can manually edit the content of each section of the canvas.
- **Save and Load Canvas:** Users can save their canvas as a JSON file and load it back into the tool for further editing.
- **Export Canvas:** Users can export their canvas in a printable format (e.g., HTML or PDF).
- **Business Document Generation:** Users can generate different types of business documents based on their saved Business Model Canvases. The first document type to be implemented is the SWOT analysis.

### 4.2. User Interface

- **Interactive Canvas:** The Business Model Canvas will be displayed in an interactive, grid-based layout.
- **User-Friendly Editor:** A simple and intuitive editor for modifying the content of each section.
- **Responsive Design:** The tool will be accessible on various devices, including desktops, tablets, and smartphones.

### 4.3. LLM Integration

- **DeepSeek API:** The initial version of the tool will use the DeepSeek API to generate the canvas content.
- **Expandable to Other Models:** The architecture should allow for easy integration of other LLM APIs in the future.

## 5. Technical Requirements

- **Frontend:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend:** PHP
- **Data Storage:** JSON files
- **Deployment:** The application should be deployable on any standard web server with PHP support.

## 6. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** The tool should be fast and responsive, with minimal loading times.
- **Usability:** The user interface should be intuitive and easy to use, even for non-technical users.
- **Security:** API keys and other sensitive information should be handled securely.
- **Scalability:** The application should be able to handle a reasonable number of users and requests.

## 7. Future Vision

Based on user feedback and forward-looking strategy, the following long-term architectural and functional goals have been identified:

- **Evolve into a General Project Planning Tool:** Expand the application's purpose beyond just business model generation. It should become a versatile tool for planning personal, group, or academic projects.

- **Folder-Based Project Organization:** Transition from the current flat-file structure in the `data/` directory to a more organized system where each project has its own dedicated folder. This will improve scalability and make project management more intuitive.

- **Master Project Index File:** Introduce a master JSON file (e.g., `projects.json`) in the `data/` directory. This file will serve as the single source of truth for all projects, storing metadata like project names, folder paths, and last modified dates. This will simplify project discovery and management, eliminating the need to scan the entire directory for files on each page load.
